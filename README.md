# 🏈 Sleeper Best Ball

A simple Streamlit app that projects fantasy football matchup scores for best ball leagues

Sleeper currently prioritizes scored points over future player projections, even if those projections are higher, causing a misleading projected score and winner. 

This app provides optimistic projections, leveraging https://github.com/dtsong/sleeper-api-wrapper to query the sleeper API, and is available for use at  https://sleeper-best-ball.streamlit.app/
